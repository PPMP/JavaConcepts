/*Demonstrating inner classes
InnerClass can be static - makes it stand alone class
can instantiate by calling constructor directly. Static methods/classes
cannot make static reference to static field. However, non static classes and methods 
can access static fields. Static means independent of instances of classe.
Innerclass can access instance variables and methods of super class
Super class has access to Inner class with instantiation and initialization of inner
classes constructor*/
